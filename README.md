Votice is a native Swift SDK that allows you to integrate user feedback, suggestion boards, and voting mechanisms in your app with a clean UI and a simple setup. It connects to a custom backend using HMAC authentication and does not require Firebase or GoogleService-Info.plist.

## üì± Management App

The Votice management app for handling suggestions and apps is available for download on the App Store:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Support for tvOS will be available in future releases.

## üõ† Installation

Add this line to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/artcc/votice-sdk", from: "1.0.1"),
```

Or via Xcode:

1. Open your project.
2. Go to **File > Add Packages...**
3. Enter the URL of the Votice repo.
4. Choose the latest version.

## üì¶ Package Info

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.9
let package = Package(
    name: "Votice",
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v17),
        .macOS(.v14),
        .tvOS(.v17)
    ],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "VoticeSDK",
            targets: ["VoticeSDK"]
        )
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "VoticeSDK",
            path: "Sources/Votice"
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "VoticeTests",
            dependencies: ["VoticeSDK"],
            path: "Tests/VoticeTests"
        )
    ]
)
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Configure the SDK (Mandatory)

Before using any Votice component, configure it with your app credentials:

```swift
import VoticeSDK

try Votice.configure(
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    apiSecret: "your-api-secret",
    appId: "your-app-id"
)
```

You can reset or check configuration status:

```swift
Votice.reset()

let configured = Votice.isConfigured
```

### 2. Show the Feedback UI (Mandatory)

You can embed the main interface as a SwiftUI view:

```swift
Votice.feedbackView()
```

Or present it as a modal sheet:

```swift
Votice.feedbackSheet(isPresented: $isShowingFeedback)
```

### 3. Customize Appearance (Optional)

Use the default system-adaptive theme:

```swift
let theme = Votice.systemTheme()
```

Or create your own theme:

```swift
let theme = Votice.createTheme(
    primaryColor: .blue,
    backgroundColor: .white,
    surfaceColor: .gray.opacity(0.1)
)
```

Advanced configuration is also available:

```swift
let customTheme = Votice.createAdvancedTheme(
    primaryColor: .purple,
    accentColor: .pink,
    backgroundColor: Color(.systemBackground),
    surfaceColor: Color(.secondarySystemBackground),
    destructiveColor: .red,
    successColor: .mint,
    warningColor: .orange)    
```

Then pass it into the view:

```swift
Votice.feedbackView(theme: theme)
```

### 4. Localize Texts (Optional)

You can provide custom localized texts by conforming to `VoticeTextsProtocol`:

```swift
Votice.setTexts(MyCustomTexts())
```

To reset to the default English:

```swift
Votice.resetTextsToDefault()
```

### 5. Using Custom Fonts (Optional)

You can customize all SDK interface fonts using your own fonts included in your project. This allows you to maintain visual consistency with your app's identity.

#### 1. Add your fonts to the project

1. Drag the font files (.ttf, .otf) into your Xcode project.
2. Make sure to add them in the "Copy Bundle Resources" section of your target.
3. Add the font names in the `Fonts provided by application` field in your Info.plist.

#### 2. Configure fonts in Votice

Create a font configuration and apply it to the SDK before displaying any Votice view:

```swift
let poppinsConfig = VoticeFontConfiguration(
    fontFamily: "Poppins",
    weights: [
        .regular: "Poppins-Regular",
        .medium: "Poppins-Medium",
        .semiBold: "Poppins-SemiBold",
        .bold: "Poppins-Bold"
    ]
)
Votice.setFonts(poppinsConfig)
```

- `fontFamily`: Name of the font family (must match the name registered in the system).
- `weights`: Dictionary with the exact names of each font weight variant.

#### 3. Reset to the system font

If you want to revert to the default iOS font:

```swift
Votice.resetFontsToSystem()
```

#### 4. Themes with custom fonts

You can create a theme that respects the custom font:

```swift
let theme = Votice.createThemeWithCurrentFonts(primaryColor: .blue)
```

Or use the system theme with the custom font:

```swift
let theme = Votice.systemThemeWithCurrentFonts()
```

Then pass it to the feedback view:

```swift
Votice.feedbackView(theme: theme)
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you do not configure custom fonts, the SDK will use the default system fonts.

### 6. Comment on susgestions (Optional)

You can allow users to comment on suggestions by enabling the comments feature (Default is enabled):

```swift
Votice.setCommentIsEnabled(enabled: Bool)
```

### 7. Debug Logging (Optional)

By default, Votice SDK runs silently to avoid cluttering your development console. If you need to troubleshoot SDK issues or see internal operations, you can enable debug logging (Default is disabled):

Enable debug logging (useful for troubleshooting):
```swift
Votice.setDebugLogging(enabled: true)
```

Check current logging status:
```swift
let isLoggingEnabled = Votice.isDebugLoggingEnabled
```

Disable when no longer needed:
```swift
Votice.setDebugLogging(enabled: false)
```

**When to use debug logging:**
- Troubleshooting network requests to your backend
- Verifying SDK configuration
- Understanding internal SDK behavior
- During development/testing phases

**Note:** Debug logging is automatically disabled in production builds and should only be enabled when specifically needed for debugging purposes.
